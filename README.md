# Code-for-storms
1. ACE Calculator - A simple script that produces TC duration & ACE for 6 hour intervals. I may revamp this in the future.
2. CKZ Script - Input parameters, it will output the pressure for the TC as defined by the landmark Courtney 2009 paper.
3. Dvorak DT - A C++ script that automatically calculates the DT according to Jack Beven's revision of the Dvorak Technique, circa 2010+.
4. Converter - A vital python script composed by my friend Sam, I adjusted it a bit. This script converts pre-2000 JTWC BT into HURDAT format.
Since the script uses a file as input, I have enclosed the For storms.txt file that it takes in as input in this repository.
